### Purpose

Making an interactive app that allows you to interact with the different elements of a production function.

Production function takes the form Y = A * K^alpha * N^1-alpha where alpha is the capital share of output.

```{r}
N <- 143.9
A <- 25.11

alpha <- 0.2


df <- tibble(k = 1:50)

df %>% 
  mutate(k_alpha = k^alpha,
         y = A*k_alpha*(N^(1-alpha))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(k, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_abline() +
  labs(x = "Level of capital",
       y = "Level of output")
```
